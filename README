blender_render: The Brown Synthetic Scene Database*
---


This is (so far) the original rendering pipeline in Blender created by Caleb Weinreb.
To get this set up on your machine, I'm pretty sure all you've got to do right now is (and I'm pretty sure this list will get shorter):
  -- copy over the Assets directory from wherever the data is (todo: figure this structure out)
  -- place a Blender executable in the aptly-named Blender_exec directory.
Run Scripts/render.py from this directory and you're good to go!


*: both are placeholder names, of course
